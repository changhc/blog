I went on a short trip in Lyon and visited a few "bouchons". A [bouchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouchon) is a (usually) small restaurant that mainly serves not sophisticated but traditional local dishes. Bouchons were originally for workers around Lyon, so in general they serve meat dishes with a stronger flavour compared with other types of French cooking. Here I'm going to introduce the bouchons I visited and the dishes I had.

## Le Bouchon des Cordeliers

Address: 15, rue Claudia, 69002 Lyon [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/D2oQ68P4uhriZWgt6)

They offered a lunch menu (26.50 EUR) that includes an entrée, a main dish, and a dessert or cheese plate. All dishes I ordered are Lyonnais.

#### Entrée: Salade Lyonnaise

A warm veggie salad with sliced pork belly, fried bread cubes, and a poached egg. The dressing was light, containing a sour taste probably stemming from vinegar. The pork belly smelled nice, was a bit salty but just nice with the salad.

#### Main: Quenelle Lyonnaise au Brochet, sauce Homardine, Riz Pilaf

[Quenelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle) is a fluffy dish made from fish (but there was no taste of fish). It is always served with sauce, while restaurants might decide to serve with different kinds of sauce. The whole iron plate was baked and served directly, so the waitress couldn't have tried harder telling me not to touch the iron plate. Most of the taste of this dish came from the sauce (the quenelle "cake" itself only had a slight flavour). One can also have this dish with bread (served for free). The bread in this bouchon was nice (at least for me).

This dish was accompanied by a small dish of yellow rice: Riz Pilaf. I'm not sure if it's always served with quenelle (I had this rice too in another bouchon). It looked pretty plain, but both the taste and the texture were BRILLIANT. It had a rich taste of butter, but I also sensed some other unknown spice. In terms of texture, it was just nicely cooked, _al dente_. I kind of know what being al dente is like for pasta, but for rice, this was the first time, totally different from what I knew about rice.

#### Dessert: Cervelle de canut

[Cervelle de canut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervelle_de_canut) is made from cheese. The texture is just as its name, soft and smooth. It's seasoned with mainly olive oil, vinegar, and a lot of green onion. I wouldn't say it was tasty, at least not for me, but inspiring. A bit too strong for me after the main dish.
